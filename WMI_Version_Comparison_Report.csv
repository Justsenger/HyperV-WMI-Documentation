If both IOPSLimit and IOPSReservation are defined, the value of IOPSLimit must be greater or equal to IOPSReservation. This property is expressed in normalized I/Os per second. Each I/O request is accounted for as 1 normalized I/O if the size of the request is less than or equal to a predefined base size (8KB). Requests that are larger than the base size are accounted for as N I/Os, where N is the rounded-up value of the request size divided by the base size (for example, if the base size is 8KB, a 32KB requests is counted as 4 normalized I/Os, a 64KB request as 8 normalized I/Os, etc...)."

The EnabledLogicalElement addresses the same semantics. The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property. To remain compatible with those implementations, StartMode was grandfathered into the schema.
