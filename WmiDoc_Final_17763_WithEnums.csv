To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following ""preferred"" algorithm:  <OrgID>:<LocalID>  Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority.

When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>.  <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements.

OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element.

This property is deprecated in lieu of OperationalStatus, which includes the same semantics in its enumeration. This change is made for 3 reasons:  1) Status is more correctly defined as an array. This definition overcomes the limitation of describing status using a single value, when it is really a multi-valued property (for example, an element might be OK AND Stopped.  2) A MaxLen of 10 is too restrictive and leads to unclear enumerated values.  3) The change to a uint16 data type was discussed when CIM V2.0 was defined. However, existing V1.0 implementations used the string property and did not want to modify their code. Therefore, Status was grandfathered into the Schema. Use of the deprecated qualifier allows the maintenance of the existing property, but also permits an improved definition using OperationalStatus."

A positive or negative integer indicates whether the RunDay should be calculated from the beginning or end of the month. For example, 5 indicates the fifth day in the RunMonth and -1 indicates the last day in the RunMonth.   When RunDayOfWeek is not 0, RunDay is the day-in-month on which the Job is processed, defined in conjunction with RunDayOfWeek. For example, if RunDay is 15 and RunDayOfWeek is Saturday, then the Job is processed on the first Saturday on or after the 15th day in the RunMonth (for example, the third Saturday in the month). If RunDay is 20 and RunDayOfWeek is -Saturday, then this indicates the first Saturday on or before the 20th day in the RunMonth.

(This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> must not contain a colon (':'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>.  <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not re-used across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance.

Following is a brief description of the states:  New (2) indicates that the job has never been started.  Starting (3) indicates that the job is moving from the 'New', 'Suspended', or 'Service' states into the 'Running' state.  Running (4) indicates that the Job is running.  Suspended (5) indicates that the Job is stopped, but can be restarted in a seamless manner.  Shutting Down (6) indicates that the job is moving to a 'Completed', 'Terminated', or 'Killed' state.  Completed (7) indicates that the job has completed normally.  Terminated (8) indicates that the job has been stopped by a 'Terminate' state change request. The job and all its underlying processes are ended and can be restarted (this is job-specific) only as a new job.  Killed (9) indicates that the job has been stopped by a 'Kill' state change request. Underlying processes might have been left running, and cleanup might be required to free up resources.  Exception (10) indicates that the Job is in an abnormal state that might be indicative of an error condition. Actual status might be displayed though job-specific objects.  Service (11) indicates that the Job is in a vendor-specific state that supports problem discovery, or resolution, or both.

"CIM_EnabledLogicalElement","RequestedState","UInt16","Property","RequestedState is an integer enumeration that indicates the last requested or desired state for the element, irrespective of the mechanism through which it was requested. The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 (""Not Applicable""), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration.  ""Unknown"" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown. Note that the value ""No Change"" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is ""Unknown"" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value ""Unknown"" (0), but may have the value ""No Change"" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState.  It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are ""Reboot"" (10) and ""Reset"" (11). Reboot refers to doing a ""Shut Down"" and then moving to an ""Enabled"" state. Reset indicates that the element is first ""Disabled"" and then ""Enabled"". The distinction between requesting ""Shut Down"" and ""Disabled"" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests.   This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass.

"CIM_ComputerSystem","Dedicated","UInt16","Property","Enumeration indicating the purpose(s) to which the ComputerSystem is dedicated, if any, and what functionality is provided. For example, one could specify that the System is dedicated to ""Print"" (value=11) or acts as a ""Hub"" (value=8).  Also, one could indicate that this is a general purpose system by indicating 'Not Dedicated' (value=0) but that it also hosts 'Print' (value=11) or mobile phone 'Mobile User Device' (value=17) services.  A clarification is needed with respect to the value 17 (""Mobile User Device""). An example of a dedicated user device is a mobile phone or a barcode scanner in a store that communicates via radio frequency. These systems are quite limited in functionality and programmability, and are not considered 'general purpose' computing platforms. Alternately, an example of a mobile system that is 'general purpose' (i.e., is NOT dedicated) is a hand-held computer. Although limited in its programmability, new software can be downloaded and its functionality expanded by the user.  A value of ""Management"" indicates this instance is dedicated to hosting system management software. A value of ""Management Controller"" indicates this instance represents specialized hardware dedicated to systems management (i.e., a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) or service processor). The management scope of a ""Management Controller"" is typically a single managed system in which it is contained. A value of ""Chassis Manager"" indicates this instance represents a system dedicated to management of a blade chassis and its contained devices. This value would be used to represent a Shelf Controller. A ""Chassis Manager"" is an aggregation point for management and may rely on subordinate management controllers for the management of constituent parts. A value of ""Host-based RAID Controller"" indicates this instance represents a RAID storage controller contained within a host computer. A value of ""Storage Device Enclosure"" indicates this instance represents an enclosure that contains storage devices. A ""Virtual Tape Library"" is the emulation of a tape library by a Virtual Library System. A ""Virtual Library System"" uses disk storage to emulate tape libraries.A ""FC Switch"" indicates this instance is dedicated to switching layer 2 fibre channel frames. An ""Ethernet Switch"" indicates this instance is dedicated to switching layer 2 ethernet frames.

For example, when the ""Offline"" button is pushed on a Printer, the Device is no longer available to process print jobs, but could be available for diagnostics or maintenance.  If this method is successful, the Device's Availability and AdditionalAvailability properties should reflect the updated status. If a failure occurs trying to bring the Device online or offline, it should remain in its current state. IE, the request, if unsuccessful, should not leave the Device in an indeterminate state. When bringing a Device back ""Online"", from an ""Offline"" mode, the Device should be restored to its last ""Online"" state, if at all possible. Only a Device that has an EnabledState/StatusInfo of ""Enabled"" and has been configured can be brought online or taken offline.

RequestType is an input parameter that defines whether the request is for standard, class or vendor-specific information, as well as specifying the recipient. RequestValue is also an input parameter and defines the USB Descriptor Type and Index. RequestIndex is an input parameter which describes the language used to return a string Descriptor. RequestLength is both an input and output parameter. It specifies the length of the Descriptor that should be returned (on input) and what is actually returned in the Buffer parameter (on output). Buffer is an output parameter, containing the Descriptor data. The GetDescriptor method returns an integer value of 0 if the USB Descriptor is successfully returned, 1 if the request is not supported and any other number to indicate an error.  In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are 'translated' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier."

Please look at the Description in each subclass for guidelines on the approriate values for that subclass. Note that any of these formats could apply to a CompositeExtent.   Note - this property originally touched on two concepts that are now separated into this property and NameNamespace. Values 2,3,4,5,6, and 8 are retained for backwards compatibility but are deprecated in lieu of the corresponding values in CIM_StorageExtent.NameNamespace.   For example, the preferred source for SCSI virtual (RAID) disk names is from Inquiry VPD page 83 response, type 3 identifiers.

"CIM_StorageExtent","Primordial","Boolean","Property","If true, ""Primordial"" indicates that the containing System does not have the ability to create or delete this operational element. This is important because StorageExtents are assembled into higher-level abstractions using the BasedOn association. Although the higher-level abstractions can be created and deleted, the most basic, (i.e. primordial), hardware-based storage entities cannot. They are physically realized as part of the System, or are actually managed by some other System and imported as if they were physically realized. In other words, a Primordial StorageExtent exists in, but is not created by its System and conversely a non-Primordial StorageExtent is created in the context of its System. For StorageVolumes, this property will generally be false. One use of this property is to enable algorithms that aggregate StorageExtent.ConsumableSpace across all, StorageExtents but that also want to distinquish the space that underlies Primordial StoragePools. Since implementations are not required to surface all Component StorageExtents of a StoragePool, this information is not accessible in any other way."
