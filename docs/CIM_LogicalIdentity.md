The use of 'System' in the role name does not limit the scope of the association. The role name was defined in the original association, where the referenced elements were limited to LogicalElements. Since that time, it has been found valuable to instantiate these types of relationships for ManagedElements, such as Collections. So, the referenced elements of the association were redefined to be ManagedElements. Unfortunately, the role name could not be changed without deprecating the entire association. This was not deemed necessary just to correct the role name. | SystemElement represents one aspect of the Managed Element.
